            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- With the U.S. Justice Department nearing a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google for antitrust violations, a coalition of states that are conducting a parallel investigation are divided over the best strategy for taking on the internet giant, according to people familiar with the matter.While the multistate investigation into Google\u2019s dominance of the digital advertising market is in its final stages, some state attorneys general are advocating to take more time to investigate Google\u2019s conduct in other markets and potentially bring a broader case against the company, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.The disagreement could affect whether states join a Justice Department complaint about Google. Like the states, federal antitrust enforcers have been investigating whether Google is thwarting competition in the digital advertising market, where it holds a commanding position.The Justice Department, which is coordinating with the states, wants to move quickly, two of the people said, and is on track to file a complaint this summer, another person said, though it wasn\u2019t clear what conduct the complaint will ultimately target. The department declined to comment.\u201cWhile we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is on creating free products that lower costs for small businesses and help Americans every day,\u201d Google said in a statement.State attorneys general can play a pivotal role in enforcement cases against companies when they band together in group investigations. They joined the Justice Department in suing Microsoft Corp. in 1998 for antitrust violations. The case nearly led to the break-up of the company when a judge sided with the government. After an appeals court reversed the ruling, the Justice Department under the George W. Bush administration settled the case.Two people familiar with the states\u2019 investigation said the split among the states reflects normal tension about the best litigation strategy. A broad complaint would cover more conduct but would take more time to complete.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the investigation into Google\u2019s conduct in the digital advertising market, which was announced in September on the steps of the Supreme Court. Other states, including Utah and Iowa, are focusing on internet search. Google dominates web search in the U.S., and rivals have complained that the company has prioritized its own services, such as travel and restaurant reviews, in results.Texas declined to comment. Representatives from Utah and Iowa didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The digital advertising part of the probe focuses on Google\u2019s control of the tools that deliver display ads across the web. Google owns much of the technology used by publishers and advertisers to buy and sell advertising space. Google has been accused of using its dominance to siphon advertising dollars from publishers.Earlier: Google Antitrust Road Map Goes to DOJ With U.S. Suit LoomingTexas is in the later stages of its probe in advertising and could join the Justice Department\u2019s case with some states, said two of the people. States are still waiting to get a full look into the federal complaint, one of the people said.The investigations are so complex that few among the enforcers have a sense of what the Justice Department and all the states are doing, two of the people said.The investigation into online search is not advanced as far as Texas\u2019s probe into the digital ad market, and some states are pushing for more time to investigate, said the people. At one point, states were also looking the company\u2019s mobile operating system, Bloomberg reported last year, though it wasn\u2019t clear whether that is an active part of the investigation.The chief executive officer of Google search rival DuckDuckGo Inc. said last month that state and federal enforcers have asked detailed questions about how to limit Google\u2019s power in the search market as recently as the spring.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you\u2019re concerned about the pervasive role in daily life of technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, then its planned $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit Inc. is a worry.Google already owns the biggest search engine, the most popular video-streaming site (YouTube), the biggest mobile operating system (Android) and the dominant e-mail service (Gmail).\u00a0All of these feed a digital-advertising business that generated $135 billion of sales last year. Do we really want to add Fitbit\u2019s fitness tracking to its armory?A coalition of 20 organizations on Thursday urged antitrust authorities in the European Union, the U.S. and five other jurisdictions to scrutinize the takeover more closely. The EU plans to rule on the deal by July 20, although it may extend the probe if needed.The problem is that Google\u2019s dominance in one market \u2014\u00a0digital advertising \u2014\u00a0isn\u2019t necessarily enough, from an antitrust perspective, to block a deal in another sector. Google doesn\u2019t currently make a health tracker or smartwatch. As such, it doesn\u2019t compete with Fitbit. It isn\u2019t trying to consolidate\u00a0the market or cut the number of rivals. Indeed, a better capitalized Fitbit might improve competition in a smartwatch market\u00a0dominated by Apple Inc.But this deal isn\u2019t really about hardware sales:\u00a0Fitbit\u2019s $1 billion in expected 2020 revenue would represent just 0.7% of Alphabet\u2019s total. The value from the acquisition is in the data that Fitbit is accumulating on all of its users. Knowing how far, how often and where people walk, run, cycle or swim every day could help advertisers, health insurers, city planners and plenty more besides. While Google is unlikely to sell that information directly to advertisers, it would help\u00a0it build more complete\u00a0advertising profiles of its users. In that sense, the fitness tracker market isn\u2019t discrete from Google\u2019s dominant ad-tech business.\u00a0It could feed it, extending its dominance.With that in mind, regulators could impose restrictions while still clearing the deal. Aitor Ortiz, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, expects behavioral remedies will be imposed. That could mean Google promising not to merge Fitbit data with other user info without explicit consent. The tech giant takes a similar approach with Nest, a home automation company it acquired in 2014.\u00a0Last year, it started encouraging users to merge their Nest data with their Google accounts.For those alarmed about Alphabet\u00a0hoarding even more of our personal data, these promises probably won\u2019t be enough. A stronger remedy would be to prohibit Google from ever extracting fitness information from a user\u2019s devices. That\u2019s how Apple treats fitness data from its Watch. Google insists that it wants Fitbit anyway, even without being able to farm its data. If that\u2019s true, then it shouldn\u2019t have any complaint about such a restriction. The purchase would still give it an entree to the smartwatch market, which will grow to $96 billion by 2027, according to Allied Market Research.Fitbit\u2019s products also need to keep working with Apple\u2019s mobile operating system as well as with Android. Otherwise, they would become a tool to force people to buy Android devices.This is an important test case that will be hard for regulators to get right. Past attempts at imposing behavioral remedies on the tech giants have failed: Facebook Inc. told Brussels back in 2014 that it wasn\u2019t technically possible to merge\u00a0its data with those of WhatsApp, but then it went ahead and did it anyway, accepting a\u00a0paltry 110 million-euro\u00a0($124 million) fine from the European Commission for breaking its agreement. Google tends to be better behaved than Facebook, but its deep pockets give it a lot of power.Given the risks, the easiest solution might just be to block the Fitbit deal outright. But that would be legally harder to justify.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe&#39;s technology, media and communications industries.
